## üè¢ Company Best Suited for the Solution

### **HERE Technologies** ‚Äî *Primary Partner*

**Reasons:**
- The platform already relies on **HERE Traffic API v7** for real-time traffic flow and jam factor data.
- HERE provides **historical and predictive traffic datasets**, which are essential for training and benchmarking.
- Integration with HERE‚Äôs ecosystem (Routing, Map Tiles, Incidents) could extend this project toward a full **smart mobility decision system**.

**Additional Collaboration Opportunities:**
- **Trafi :** Vilnius-born MaaS platform with city deployments and mobility intelligence; useful for fusing public transport demand with road traffic insights.
- **TomTom:** alternative/backup traffic data and Traffic Index benchmarks; Lithuania (including Vilnius) is covered by TomTom traffic products.
- **Vilnius Traffic Management Centre (JUDU):** ideal municipal stakeholder and deployment venue for decision support dashboards.
